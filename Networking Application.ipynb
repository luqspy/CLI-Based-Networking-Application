This application mimics a social media environment made specifically for students, allowing them to create profiles, send and receive messages, manage study groups, add friends, and track their activities. Built using object-oriented programming principles in C++, the application makes use of various abstract data types (ADTs) including Doubly Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, and Circular Linked Lists to ensure efficient data management and user interaction.It also makes use of various other concepts like try catch error, templates etc.\n",

There are two viewing option, one allows you to view all of the members altogether and the other allows you to go through them one by one, which due to the grouops being composed of circular linked list, all loop around each other.\n",
